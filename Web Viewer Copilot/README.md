Web viewers in FileMaker Pro are a great way to extend the platform and create new UI components that would otherwise be impossible. The results can be extremely powerful, but working with web viewers and writing the code in FileMaker Pro can be a huge pain, due to the lack of a proper code editor with formatting and syntax highlighting. Thatâ€™s what led me to build this CodeMirror Web Viewer app last year, to simplify the process of writing and testing web viewer code. This app makes developing new web viewers much easier, by eliminating the need to copy/paste code into a separate code editor. However, I still found myself copy/pasting code in chatGPT for more advanced solutions. 

So I decided to take this a step further, and integrate the CodeMirror app with the ChatFMP app I made for integrating with an OpenAI Assistant. This enables you to describe the web viewer you want in plain English, and the assistant will return the code and generate a new UI component with a single prompt.
